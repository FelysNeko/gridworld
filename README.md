# GridWorld

Handwritten implementation of some basic reinforcement learning algorithms in a gridworld.

## Usage

Make sure `numpy` is installed, and then run:

```shell
python3 demo.py
```
The [implementation](gridworld) is more interesting than actually using it, since that is where maths comes to play.
